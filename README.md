# Dockerized Spring Boot Microservices

This sample application consist of spring boot registry service (Netflix Eureka), edge service (Netflix Zuul), sample user registration application and user consumer application. 



### Prerequisites

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Docker]( https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ )
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Running the application

Download or clone git repository, then use maven to build projects. You can also run this project as a java application or spring boot applicaiton if you are using STS. 

- Service Registry:
Spring Boot Eureka (Netflix Eureka) service registry server.
- Edge Service
Spring Boot Zuul (Netflix Zuul) server.
- User app:
This is the sample spring boot REST API, exposes 2 end points. 

    - /registerUser
    
Json structure

```

{
	"userId":1,
	"name":"user_name",
	"email":"username@gmail.com"	
}

Example:
http://localhost:8083/userapp/registerUser

```

    - /getUser    

```
Example:
http://localhost:8083/userapp/getUser?userID=1

```

- User app consumer: 
This is the sample spring boot application, exposes similar end point as user app and internally calls user app using load balanced REST template.
You can either call useapp or user-consumer end points via zuul.

    - /registerUser
    
```   

    Example:
    http://localhost:8083/user-consumer/registerUser 
    
```

    - /getUser
    
    
```    
    
    Example:
    http://localhost:8083/user-consumer/getUser?userID=1
    
```

If application runs successfully, you are ready to build docker images.

## Docker build

- You can use docker engine or maven plugin to build docker image.
- Before you build docker image:
   - Edit application.properties file and replace localhost with appropriate ip address.
   - Edit pom.xml file and enter appropriate value for ```<docker.image.prefix>```.
- If you intend to push docker images to your private repository such as Azure ACR or Amazone ECR, edit the pom.xml file from each service and enter appropriate values for ```<serverId>``` and  ```<repositoryUrl>```.
- Here is the maven command to build docker image:

```
mvn package docker:build

```
- This should build docker image using the Dockerfile provided in the each service.  
- Use below maven command to build and push docker image to private container repository:

```
mvn package docker:build -DpushImage

```

- if you are not able to push images using above command, push images using docker engine.

```
docker push <image_name>

```
